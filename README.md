This is my attempt at the alamo drafthouse interview project.  

HUGE CAVEAT: I was a fool and didn't tackle this with responsiveness in mind from the start.  If I had more time I would redo it with a responsive boilerplate like Bootstrap.  If you don't want to punch yourself, don't view this on anything other than laptop form factors.  

## Run Locally

`npm install && npm run start`

Changes to sass files won't live reload, you have to manually reload for those changes.

## Code Structure

Most of the markup is located in `src/App.js`.
You can view the styles in `public/styles.scss`
